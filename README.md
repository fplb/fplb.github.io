# [FPLongBeach.com](http://FPLongBeach.com) website repo

## About
The website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Github hosts static HTML and Jekyll based websites for free.  Github uses a default naming scheme for repositories, and as a result our site can be viewed at  [http://fplb.github.io/](http://fplb.github.io) -- but it is setup for its own domain: FPLongBeach.com.  Github allows us to utilize our custom domain by adding a [CNAME file and configuring our DNS](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-a-cname-record-with-your-dns-provider/).  Therefore our website is best accessed at:  [FPLongBeach.com](http://www.FPLongBeach.com)
