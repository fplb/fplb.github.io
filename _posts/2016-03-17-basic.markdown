BASIC: Then and Now.
Speaker: David Nuon

We're doing something different this time around :)  

Code Club is an FPLB event where we examine a programming language and discuss its history, usage and implementation. If you're interested with how programming languages work and how they're made, this is the event for you!

This time we're going to talk about an oldie but goodie, BASIC. BASIC is simple, easy to learn and easy to implement. Because of this, it spread and defined a generation of programmers.

We're going to discuss BASIC's creation, where it is today and walk through an ES6 implementation of BASIC.

We're going to have an interactive demo, so bring a laptop!
